# About makeUp 2.0

**makeUp 2.0** is an easy to use, flexible, endless scalable, lightweight PHP framework. It was originally conceived in 2009 as an MVC pattern, for the complex application of a German telecommunications company, by Martin Wolf. In 2016 it was completely refactored and adjusted to support capabilities of PHP 5.6. Since then it wasn´t tested in large-scale use. So you can use it at your own risk. But you can let me know if you stumble upon errors and/or problems.

**makeUp 2.0** as it comes is specifically designed to develop applications based on Twitter Bootstrap easily from the ground up. Maybe in a future update more frontend frameworks will be supported. For now, with a little tweaking, you can include any other frameworks on your own, if you like.

Last but not least: The processing of the templates was inspired by the early TYPO3 framework of Kasper Skårhøj. Although it would be easy to include a modern template engine, I have taken over the basic functionality of the old TYPO3, because I always liked it.

Have fun!

# Basic requirements

The easiest way to work with **makeUp 2.0**, is with **PHP 7.2** or above, **SASS** and **Composer** installed and a local **webserver** with the **rewrite module** (mod_rewrite) enabled. For data processing you need a **MySQL** database. If you have installed Xampp or something similar lately, you are probably already set up.

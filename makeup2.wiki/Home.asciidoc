About makeUp
------------

*makeUp* is an easy to use, flexible, endless scalable, lightweight PHP framework and a compilation of popular frontend libraries. It is a package that includes almost everything you need to build awesome web applications from the ground up. 

The PHP framework was originally conceived as an MVC pattern, for the complex application of a German telecommunications company, by Martin Wolf. In 2016 it was adjusted to support some capabilities of PHP 5.6 and wasnÂ´t tested in large-scale use since then. So please let me know if you stumble upon errors and problems. 

Not to forget: the processing of the templates was inspired by the early TYPO3 framework. Although it would be easy to include a modern template engine, I kept it, because I still like it. :-)

Read the _Installation & Usage_ guide before you continue.

Have fun!
